# SignatureWork
There are three GitHub projects linked to this page that I worked on either by my self or with a small group.<br /><br />
The first project is a simple website that I made about myself. The whole website was made from scratch and has information like what school I go to, what I worked on in the past, my resume, and what I do in my free time. I learned how to create websites from this project.<br /><br />

The second project is about simple 2D animations that I made with a group. There are four animations with simple shapes moving, rotating, and changing size. I learned how to make it look like the object is moving on the screen from this project.<br /><br />

The third project is about simple 3D projections and clipping that I made with a group. You can move the image freely and it will clip if you move it out of bounds. I learned how to make images look 3D on the screen from this project.<br /><br />
