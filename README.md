# SignatureWork
There are three GitHub projects linked to this page that I worked on either by my self or with a small group.
The first project is a simple website that I made about myself. The whole website was made from scratch and has information like what school I go to, what I worked on in the past, my resume, and what I do in my free time.

The second project is about simple 2D animations that I made with a group. There are four animations with simple shapes moving, rotating, and changing size.
